## Installation

This tutorial assumes that you have docker setup and running on your machine. 

You can install the CLI by getting our installation script.

### Linux / MacOS 
```bash
$ wget -q https://appwrite.io/cli/install.sh  -O - | /bin/bash  
```

### Windows
```powershell
$ iwr -useb https://appwrite.io/cli/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Initialisation 
The CLI needs to be initialised with your project settings. This can be done using 
```sh
$ appwrite init 
```

The CLI requires an endpoint, project ID, API key and a locale to be able to communicate with the Appwrite backend server. There are two ways to achieve this 

### 1. Pass in the project settings along with `appwrite init`

```sh
$ appwrite init --endpoint="YOUR ENDPOINT" --project="YOUR PROJECT ID" --key="YOUR API KEY" --locale="YOUR LOCALE"
```

If any of the required values are missing, a prompt will show up, asking for those missing values.

### 2. Using the prompt

Invoking `appwrite init` without any params triggers an interactive prompt where you can manually enter the details. These values are saved locally so that you dont have to re-enter them everytime. 

### Note
By default, requests to domains with self signed SSL certificates (or no certificates) are disabled. If you trust the domain, you can bypass the certificate validation by using
```sh
$ appwrite client setSelfSigned --value=true 
```

## Usage 

The Appwrite CLI follows the following general syntax.
```sh
$ appwrite [SERVICE] [COMMAND] --[OPTIONS]
```

A few sample commands to get you started 

```sh
$ appwrite users create --email="hello@appwrite.io" --password="very_strong_password"
$ appwrite users list 
```

To create a Document you can use the following command 
```sh
$ appwrite database createDocument --collectionId="YOUR COLLECTION ID" --data='A VALID JSON STRING' --read=role:member --read="*" --write=role:guest
```

### Some Gotchas
- `data` expects the JSON string to be escaped.
- If using the wildcard (`*`) read or write permissions , make sure that it is properly escaped using a `\` or by enclosing it in `"*"` since bash interprets them differently.
- Some arguments like `read` and `write` permissions are expected to be arrays. In the Appwrite CLI, arrays are passed by simply repeating the argument as seen in the `createDocument` example above.

To get information about the different services available, you can use 
```sh
$ appwrite help
```

To get information about a particular service and the commands available in a service you can use 
```sh
$ appwrite users help
$ appwrite accounts help
```

To get information about a particular command and the parameters it accepts, you can use

```sh
$ appwrite users list --help
$ appwrite account get --help 
```

## Contribution

This library is auto-generated by Appwrite custom [SDK Generator](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator). To learn more about how you can help us improve this SDK, please check the [contribution guide](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a pull-request.

To build and test the CLI for development, follow these steps 

1. Clone the SDK Generator
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-generator
```

2. Ensure that docker is running locally and then run 
```sh 
$ cd sdk-generator

# Install the composer dependencies
$ docker run --rm --interactive --tty --volume "$(pwd)":/app composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --optimize-autoloader --no-plugins --no-scripts --prefer-dist

# Generate the SDKs
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app php:7.4-cli php example.php
```

3. Head over to the generated SDK and build the CLI docker image 
```sh
$ cd examples/CLI
$ docker build -t appwrite/cli .
```

4. Install the CLI

MacOS and Linux

Open `install.sh` and change [this line](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/blob/master/install.sh#L33) to `APPWRITE_CLI_IMAGE_VERSION=latest` and 
comment [these lines](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/blob/master/install.sh#L119-L123). 

You can now install the CLI using 
```sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh
```

Windows

Open `install.ps1` and change [this line](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/blob/master/install.ps1#L28) to `APPWRITE_CLI_IMAGE_VERSION=latest` and 
comment [these lines](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-cli/blob/master/install.ps1#L85-L89)

You can now install the CLI using 
```sh
$ ./install.ps1
```
